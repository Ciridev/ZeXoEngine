## ZeXo Engine
ZeXo Engine is a 2D Game Engine that I am currently developing. 
This is my first ever attempt to make a Game Engine on my own. 
Feel free to share suggestions or improve code! 
P.S. This project is inspired by Hazel Engine by The Cherno.

## Goal
I am making ZeXo for educational purpose. The goal is to have a better understanding of OpenGL.
The idea is to make a robust Game Engine for 2D Videogames. Once ZeXo 2D is ready there will be a huge step up
and ZeXo will be able to support 3D rendering (Hopefully!)

## Main features to come
* Layers 
* GLAD
* ImGui
* Math library (Linear Algebra Math Library that supports vector and matrix calculations like glm)
* OpenGL Renderer
* ZeXo Editor (?)
* Much more!
